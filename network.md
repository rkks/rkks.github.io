and protocol role assignment for *[PTX family](https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/products-services/routing/ptx-series/)*
multi-chassis core router. Develops the **fault detection, isolation, and recovery framework** for high-speed SERDES
based ASIC interconnects in *[T-series standalone](http://www.juniper.net/uk/en/products-services/routing/t4000/)* products.

- Develops innovative method of **reusing IS-IS as loop-free topo-mgmt solution** without overhead of STP

2007 - 2011
:   *Network Solutions Developer* for **[Continuous Computing, Ltd.](http://www.ccpu.com/)**

As a Technical Leader, delivers **\#2** carrier-grade and **\#2** enterprise-grade solutions mentoring a **team of 6**.

- *[FastPath SCTP](http://www.radisys.com/2010/continuous-computing-optimizes-trillium-sctp-fast-path-to-achieve-unprecedented-10x-performance-improvement/)*
is a carrier-grade, highly optimized, stateful gateway solution. It gives bi-di throughput of **1M pps** of 1500B
SCTP packets over 10G links. It extends 6Wind FastPath stack on NetLogic XLR NPUs. Ravi delivers complex zero-copy
packet forwarding & scheduler, in-place IPSec, DMA and DNS support.

- *[Layer2 HA](http://www.radisys.com/2010/allot-communications-selects-continuous-computing-to-deliver-better-traffic-management-for-network-operators/)*
is an enterprise-grade network resilience solution. It gives **sub-msec** failover, weighted traffic mapping as
hub-n-spoke, and faster convergence by VRRP enhancement. It is implemented as extension to Fulcrum ControlPoint
on Switch and Bonding Driver enhancement on x86 Blades. Ravi delivers entire product, from ideation to deployment,
pens white papers, customer support. It generates **>$3M** revenue.

- *[FlexBalance](http://picmg.opensystemsmedia.com/articles/atca-load-balancing-40-gbps/)* is an enterprise-grade
server load balancer. It does **statistical hashing** of traffic marked by **L4 flows**, MPLS tags, physical port-groups
using DWRR & CBQ schedulers. It is implemented as pattern-match & scheduler enhancement using FFU, TCAM. Ravi delivers
entire product from code to docs single handedly, works with architect and QA in different geographies, helps in
deployment, customer support. Huge commercial success, generated **>$8M** in revenue, and helped in more than **12 design wins**.

Open Source Contributions
-------------------------
- [Ethernet Channel Bonding Driver enhancements](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt). Stock driver
consumes >18% bandwidth for keep-alives. The failover time is in order of several seconds. Attempt is to reduce total bandwidth
usage to less than 5% and improve failover time to 3msec. Also, enhance failure detection to identify external network failures.
- [OpenSAF bug-fixes](http://devel.opensaf.org/). During bringup and performance validation of Open-SAF in initial days of release,
had multiple bugs in the areas of tipc, sai, checkpoint and event services. Those issues are identified and fixed.
- [OpenSolaris bug-fixes](http://www.opensolaris.org/). Real-time mirroring FS and NIC-teaming driver is built around Solaris DDI/DKI API.
OpenSolaris announcement brings opportunity to study solaris kernel, harden our code, as well as fix bugs
found in OpenSolaris code. Bugs around DLPI metadata, raw socket mirroring, RX-ring scheduling fixed.

Consultation Jobs
-----------------
- SCTP based out-of-box, stateful, *[L4 load-balancer design](http://www.lisletech.com/)* for SS7 tunneling and services protocols.
- *[Line-rate IPSec Encryption Gateway](http://www.stoke.com)* optimization and debugging packet-path. It uses Netlogic XLP NPUs.
- LTE ENodeB stack porting, optimization on low-powered *[Mindspeed ARM processors](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120611005536/en/Mindspeed-Announces-High-Performance-Multi-Core-ARM-Cortex-A-CPU-Based)* using 4GMX OS.
- Fix critical kernel bugs for *[real-time mirroring file-system](http://go.ccpu.com/upSuite)* and related resilience infra on Solaris servers.
