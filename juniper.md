--------------------------------

Ravi was employed as a full-time employee, in the role of Software Engineer 3, at Juniper Networks India Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru from May/28/2012 to Aug/14/2014. His Employee ID was 000025951.

**[Juniper Networks Core Router BU](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/products/routers/ptx-series.html)** is a well-known vendor of Core Routers for IP backbone Service Providers. T-series routers provide stackable (TX), feature-rich and low-latency routing with advanced traffic engineering capabilities for SP core. Whereas, PTX-series of routers present low power-consumption, very high throughput, and space efficient routers with advanced IP/MPLS feature-set. Both router families run FreeBSD based JunOS NOS. Juniper routers are deployed at high stakes, high bandwidth, and performance critical places like Nasdaq, London Olympics, and NEP CDN. Stacking offers value-protection by allowing same family routers to be inter-connected to act as single large router with much higher throughput & port density, while keeping management overhead to a minimum.

**Responsibilities**

- Design, develop, and unit testing of IS-IS protocol based multi-chassis control plane detection, loop-free topology creation & monitoring, and role assignment feature on proposed Juniper PTX Router.
- Implement framework for fault detection, isolation, attempted recovery, and reporting of high-speed SERDES based ASIC interconnect quality in Juniper T4000 line cards to prevent silent traffic blackholing.
- Port, implement, and unit test IEEE 802.3x standard based pause frames transmission towards relevant network elements based on queue depth.
- Provide fix to any issues reported in T & TX-series families of Routers, in the areas of Fabric interconnect and Chassis Management.
- Involve in design discussions and bug reviews, do review of code and QA test-plans.
- Understand Chassis Management, IS-IS protocol, SERDES training, and ASIC blocks, flows, and registers to work on the deliverables.
- Presented technical sessions to other team members and QA in areas of project work.
- Work with documentation team to update relevant docs based on new enhancements.
- Help other team members, transfer know-how to new engineers joining the team.
