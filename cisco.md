Ravi was employed as a full-time employee, in the role of Software Engineer IV at Cisco Systems India Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru from Sep/01/2014 to Feb/09/2018. His Employee Number was 365507.

**[Cisco Systems Data Center BU](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_hk/solutions/data-center/data-center-networking.html)** is an industry leader in Data Center networking solutions that include Local Area (LAN), Wide Area (WAN), and Storage Area (SAN) Network technologies. They have in-house built feature-rich, store-n-forward, and customizable N7K family of DC switches. Through acquisition of Insieme Networks in 2013, they have ultra low-latency, cut-through, and economical N9K family of DC switches. N9K switches come with line-cards built using both in-house and Broadcom ASICs. NX-OS NOS and DCNM NMS is used on both N7K and N9K family of switches. IEEE 802.1BR standard compliant Fabric Extenders (FEX) provide higher port-density for them. The FC-over-Ethernet (FCoE) overlay protocol for carrying Fiber Channel (FC) protocol, along with other relevant infra like naming-service, spf, and so on are supported on these switches. For providing loss-less switching, the DCBX extensions to LLDP standard are used.

**Responsibilities**

- Conceptualization, design, development, demo to Architecture Board and release delivery of loss-less trace-logs using Linux ftrace on Cisco NXOS.
- Design, development, and release delivery of FCoE support over Fabric Extender (FEX) on Cisco Nexus 9000 and Nexus 7000 family of switches.
- LXC container based ISSU support for Fiber-Channel over Ethernet(FCoE)  stack on Cisco N9000 family ToR switches
- Support and fix any bugs observed on Active-Active, vPC, and FabricPath topologies when tested over the FEX traffic.
- Support and fix any issues reported in FCoE control plane and data plane of Cisco Nexus 7000 family of switches.
- Involve in gathering specific, measurable, and accurate requirements from relevant stake holders, prepare functional specification, unit test, and integration test documents.
- Gain in-depth understanding of ASIC flow, tables, and registers; as well as software process interactions, dependencies, and division of responsibilities to deliver on the assigned features.
- Perform design, code & QA test-plan reviews, provide on-need tech talks.
- Work with functional and system test engineers to qualify the developed features, quickly fix any issues identified for on-time delivery of feature.
