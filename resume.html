<h2 id="open-source-contributions">Open Source Contributions</h2>
<p>Ravi developed his like for FOSS after he was involved in Linux kernel driver related development activities in 2006. Since then, he has contributed to open-source by identifying &amp; fixing bugs, making own work available as open-source and free under liberal license. Here are some of his early contributions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt">Ethernet Channel Bonding Driver enhancements</a>. Stock driver consumes &gt;18% bandwidth for keep-alives. The failover time is in order of several seconds. Attempt is to reduce total bandwidth usage to less than 5% and improve failover time to 3msec. Also, enhance failure detection to identify external network failures.</li>
<li><a href="http://devel.opensaf.org/">OpenSAF bug-fixes</a>. During bringup and performance validation of Open-SAF in initial days of release, had multiple bugs in the areas of tipc, sai, checkpoint and event services. Those issues are identified and fixed.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/">OpenSolaris bug-fixes</a>. Real-time mirroring FS and NIC-teaming driver is built around Solaris DDI/DKI API. OpenSolaris announcement brings opportunity to study solaris kernel, harden our code, as well as fix bugs found in OpenSolaris code. Bugs around DLPI metadata, raw socket mirroring, RX-ring scheduling fixed.</li>
