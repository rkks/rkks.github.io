<dd><em>Sr. Principle Engineer, Lead for Clustering, HA and TWAMP SLA</em> at <strong><a href="https://www.versa-networks.com/">Versa Networks, Ltd.</a></strong>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As a Lead, Ravi delivers <strong>#2</strong> large scale solutions, <strong>#1</strong> patent on tehnologically significant area, and assists in fire-fighting various customer issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em><a href="https://www.versa-networks.com/products/versa-flexvnf/">Clustering for I/O and Services Scaling over Versa VOS</a></em> provides an elastic solution to increase aggregate throughput of any deployment by horizontal scaling of VOS nodes. When extended to public Clouds, this can scale on-demand. Aim is to provide a linear scale-out/scale-in architecture to deliver <strong>20 times</strong> the throughput of any individual appliance. Ravi implements core algorithm for traffic distribution and session accounting.</p></li>
<li><p><em><a href="https://versa-networks.com/documents/solution-briefs/Versa-Zero-Trust-Architecture-Overview.pdf">TWAMP</a></em> feature aims to provide fully RFC 5357 compliant, interoperable, and scalable Control/Test protocol stacks for SLA measurement in brownfield deployments having multi-vendor appliances. It interoperates with Cisco IOS, Juniper JUNOS, Nokia AOS and Arista EOS. It scales upto <strong>64K sessions</strong> and performance of <strong>&lt;20ms inter packet gap</strong>. Together with the Versa SASE Client (Endpoint Agent) and Versa Cloud Gateway, it provides last-mile SLA reports with real packet-loss measurements for remote access users and provides historical data. Ravi single-handedly implements whole protocol stack on VOS and ports it to multiple OSes for pairing with respective endpoint agents.</p></li>
<li><p><em><a href="https://versa-networks.com/news/2021/versa-granted-15th-patent-extending-sase-leadership/">Split-Brain avoidance in Inter-Chassis HA</a></em> solution provides a novel way to reliably detect peer node down. Solution is granted patent <strong>USPTO #10972337</strong>. Ravi implements the core solution and guides team members to extend the same. Ravi also implements a solution to detect, isolate, and highlight issues in configuration between nodes participating in Inter-Chassis HA. This assists to resolve issues before they begin to impact functioning of the system. Ravi develops the core framework and provides training, references and help to implement plugins for various HA-aware modules in Versa VOS.</p></li>

<dd><em>Storage Networks Developer</em> at <strong><a href="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco Systems, Inc.</a></strong>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As Individual Contributor, delivers <strong>FCoE over Fabric Extender (FEX)</strong> integration for proprietary ASIC based F4 line-cards on N7000 family of DC switches and Broadcom Trident3 chipset based N9000 family of DC switches.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ravi develops innovative <em><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/trace/ftrace.html">lossless on-demand tracing</a></em> feature for system-wide runtime debug trace logging without affecting performance on NXOS for all N9000, N7000, N3000 family of switches. By nature logs are lossy as buffering, block device driver, and file system syncing work on best-effort basis. Idea is to have elastic, realtime buffer in RAM for lossless log collection. This helps to reduce back-and-forth with customers, improves issue resolution time, and customer satisfaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ravi is <strong>invited for presenting it to NXOS Architecture Forum</strong> and feature is used on all product lines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em><a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/FCoE/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_FCoE_Configuration_Guide_7x/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_FCoE_Configuration_Guide_7x_chapter_0100.pdf">N9000 DC Leaf/Spine Switches</a></em> form the backbone of ToR &amp; EoR offerings from Cisco for Leaf and Spine Data Center fabrics. Built over ultra-low-cost homegrown ASICs as well as commodity Broadcom chipsets, these switches provide best value for money with consistent low latency and high throughput. As brownfield DCs have a mix of old and new servers, there is demand for higher number of ports for low cost. <em>Fabric Extenders (FEX)</em> fills that gap by extending number of ports available on a switch by many fold at a fraction of their cost. FCoE is a tunneling protocol that provides access to Fiber Channel/FC Storage devices over Ethernet using Converged Network Adapters (CNAs). The ethernet is turned into loss-less SAN through a collection of DC specific standards and extensions like Priority Flow Control, LLDP DCBX, SSPF, Naming Server, and so on. Ravi develops support for FCoE over FEX connected to Broadcom based N9000 line-cards by programming FEX, Trident3 chipset, Control plane, and network drivers on SUP3 as required.</p></li>
<li><p>Ravi delivers <em><a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/data-center-high-availability-redefined">Linux LXC container based NXOS ISSU</a></em> support for FCoE N9000 ToR swithces by modifying relevant Kernel Loadable Modules/KLMs in FCoE packet processing path on N9K ToR switches.</p></li>
<li><p><em><a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus7000/sw/fcoe/config/cisco_nexus7000_fcoe_config_guide/fcoe_over_fex.pdf">N7000 DC</a></em> switches formed the Core layer of 3-layered DC Fabric architecture of the past. These switches provided high bandwidth, traffic engineering and DC-Interconnect/DCI WAN acceleration features. While some Access layer features like VDP, LLDP/DCBX, User ACLs, and Overlay VTEP were left out in favour of Access switches like N3000, few others like VNTag/FEX, VPC/MLAG, and CDP were implemented in N7000 switches for Collapsed-Core architectures where Core Switch also assumes responsibility of Aggregation layer. Ravi ports support for features like FCoE over Fabric Extender/FEX, FEX Active-Active, vPC/MLAG, Phy-Port vPC, and FabricPath over N7000.</p></li>
