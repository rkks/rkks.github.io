Since then, he has contributed to open-source by identifying &amp; fixing bugs, making own work available as open-source and free under liberal license. Here are some of his early contributions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt">Ethernet Channel Bonding Driver enhancements</a>. Stock driver consumes &gt;18% bandwidth for keep-alives. The failover time is in order of several seconds. Attempt is to reduce total bandwidth usage to less than 5% and improve failover time to 3msec. Also, enhance failure detection to identify external network failures.</li>
<li><a href="http://devel.opensaf.org/">OpenSAF bug-fixes</a>. During bringup and performance validation of Open-SAF in initial days of release, had multiple bugs in the areas of tipc, sai, checkpoint and event services. Those issues are identified and fixed.</li>
