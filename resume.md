Open Source Contributions
-------------------------

Ravi developed his like for FOSS after he was involved in Linux kernel driver related development activities in 2006. Since then, he has contributed to
open-source by identifying & fixing bugs, making own work available as open-source and free under liberal license. Here are some of his early contributions.

- [Ethernet Channel Bonding Driver enhancements](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt). Stock driver consumes >18% bandwidth for
  keep-alives. The failover time is in order of several seconds. Attempt is to reduce total bandwidth usage to less than 5% and improve failover time to 3msec.
  Also, enhance failure detection to identify external network failures.
- [OpenSAF bug-fixes](http://devel.opensaf.org/). During bringup and performance validation of Open-SAF in initial days of release, had multiple bugs in the
  areas of tipc, sai, checkpoint and event services. Those issues are identified and fixed.
- [OpenSolaris bug-fixes](http://www.opensolaris.org/). Real-time mirroring FS and NIC-teaming driver is built around Solaris DDI/DKI API. OpenSolaris
  announcement brings opportunity to study solaris kernel, harden our code, as well as fix bugs found in OpenSolaris code. Bugs around DLPI metadata, raw socket
  mirroring, RX-ring scheduling fixed.
- [Personal Wiki, Resume & Code](https://github.com/rkks). This resume is auto-generated using markdown notes, pandoc utility, Bootstrap JS & CSS, and some javascript.
  Similarly, the wiki is also auto-generated from markdown notes. The repo also has tech hacks, protos, and eval tests. Mostly used for feasibility analysis, for
  ramping up on technology, and quick-n-dirty trials.
