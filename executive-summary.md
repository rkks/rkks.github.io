is a carrier-grade, highly optimized, stateful gateway solution. It gives bi-di throughput of **1M pps** of 1500B
SCTP packets over 10G links. It extends 6Wind FastPath stack on NetLogic XLR NPUs. Ravi delivers complex zero-copy
packet forwarding & scheduler, in-place IPSec, DMA and DNS support.

- *[Layer2 HA](http://www.radisys.com/2010/allot-communications-selects-continuous-computing-to-deliver-better-traffic-management-for-network-operators/)*
is an enterprise-grade network resilience solution. It gives **sub-msec** failover, weighted traffic mapping as
hub-n-spoke, and faster convergence by VRRP enhancement. It is implemented as extension to Fulcrum ControlPoint
on Switch and Bonding Driver enhancement on x86 Blades. Ravi delivers entire product, from ideation to deployment,
pens white papers, customer support. It generates **>$3M** revenue.

- *[FlexBalance](http://picmg.opensystemsmedia.com/articles/atca-load-balancing-40-gbps/)* is an enterprise-grade
server load balancer. It does **statistical hashing** of traffic marked by **L4 flows**, MPLS tags, physical port-groups
using DWRR & CBQ schedulers. It is implemented as pattern-match & scheduler enhancement using FFU, TCAM. Ravi delivers
entire product from code to docs single handedly, works with architect and QA in different geographies, helps in
deployment, customer support. Huge commercial success, generated **>$8M** in revenue, and helped in more than **12 design wins**.

- *[FlexTCA](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090901005489/en/Continuous-Computing-Launches-FlexTCA-3.0-Enhanced-DPI)*
is a carrier-grade, service availability product that pre-integrates Trillium stacks with GoAhead Saffire middleware to run
out-of-box on ATCA chassis. It implements OAM interface over SNMP & Web, Compute blade resilience using SAF SAI, Protocol
HA using DFTHA layer, Control plane HA using SAF checkpoint service, and Chassis management using SAF HPI. Ravi is responsible
for design, code and testing of **complex SAF-Trillium integration layer** that represents core value-add of product offering.

- *[UpSuite](http://go.ccpu.com/upSuite)* is a high-availability middleware providing fault identification, isolation,
and recovery along with **real-time file-system mirroring** for Solaris based servers. It implements heartbeat framework,
application monitoring framework, kernel file-system for mirroring, and **NIC resiliency driver**. Ravi is involved in doing
upgrade of file-system to Solaris 10, supporting zones, and providing bug-fixes.

2004 - 2006
:   *Software Developer* for multiple **[Bangalore based startups](https://rkks.github.io/kernel.html#consultation-jobs)**

As a Technology Consultant, he has helped in **feasibility analysis by prototyping**, **solving design challenges**,
implementation nits, **timebound resolution of critical bugs**, **optimization**, deployment engineering assistance.
